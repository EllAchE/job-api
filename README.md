# Deploy your own API for accepting interview requests ðŸš€!

Ask you prospective employers to send you POST requests instead of emails.

## Prequisites

- Requires a telegram account & bot
- Requires a functions environment to deploy to (i.e. vercel)

## Usage

```
curl -X POST http://your-endpoint-url \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message":"<message_from_recruiter>","offerInterview":true}'
```

## Deployment

I set this up on vercel functions a long time ago, and seemingly didn't document the deployment... If I did it again I'd probably use Cloudflare Workers. Open to PRs to improve this!
